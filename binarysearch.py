# Binary Search Practice
# Leet Code Problem : 
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. 
If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
