# Salem & Jared

## Write a function, sumNums, that takes a number, num, as an argument and returns 
## the sum of all the numbers between 1 and num. You can assume that num will be 
## greater than 1. Use recursion.
## sumNums(3); // => 6 (3 + 2 + 1)

## Take a number then write a function that subtracts until we get the base
## case of 1. Then create another base case where if the number is 1 return number.



### Jared wrote psuedo code. 
#### Salem wrote function. 

def sumNums(num):
    if num == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
      num == 1:
    print(num + sumNums(num - 1))

sumNums(25);
sumNums(18);
sumNums(1);
