#Assignment
#Write a function, sumNums, that takes a number, num, as an argument and returns the sum of 
#all the numbers between 1 and num. You can assume that num will be greater than 1. Use recursion.
# example: 
#sumNums(3); // => 6 (3 + 2 + 1)


# 1.) Summary of the problem in my own words
'''
Write a recursive function, sumNums, that takes a positive integer num as an argument and 
returns the sum of all the positive integers from 1 to num.
'''
# 2.) Write test cases for example inputs and outputs
# 3.) Pseudocode your plan in comments
# 4.) Commit your code as you go until you solution is complete
